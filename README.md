# comcast CGA4131COM stats to influxdb

This script gets/scrapes data from the cga4131com modem from comcast to json data. The original idea of this from https://github.com/andrewfraley/arris_cable_modem_stats/ thats a fork of https://github.com/billimek/SB6183-stats-for-influxdb
for specificly arris modems, this is just slimed down for just the cga4131com

Some of the base code - work is from https://github.com/andrewfraley
